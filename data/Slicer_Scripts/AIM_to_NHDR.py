# This script will write a .nhdr (.nrrd header) file that points to your .aim file (from Scanco).
# This way you don't have to convert all the .aim files to .nrrd and have the volumes take up twice as much room.

# This is not fully automated, there are a number of steps you need to do yourself!!

# Make sure SlicerMorph and all it's dependencies are installed on Slicer

# You will need the .txt file from IPL (?) with all the header information. If it isn't there you may be able to get it
# from ImageJ.
#
# ### Save the header info as a .txt file with the same name as the .aim file. ###
